/*

1. Project compiles and runs:
-   Yes

2. Project has sufficient documentation -  Issue Tracking, Program Comments and Commit History:
-   Project comments are missing
    All functions in .cpp files should have a single line comment specifying the author and debuggers
    Please do not forget this for the next project
-   Issue tracking is missing the hexdecimal commit values for all closed tasks
    These values make it easy to validate the Issue Tracker with the commit history
    Please do not forget this for the next project

3. Issue tracking, Program Comments and Commit History are consistent:
-   Yes

4. Submitted code matches the overall design requirements:
-   Yes

5. Submitted functions match the provided algorithms / pseudocode:
-   Yes

6. Submitted code only uses commands found in course examples, practice problems and homework:
-   Yes

7. Submitted code, output and documentation is organized and easy to read:
-   Yes

8. Implementation details:

Phase I/II: Complete

-   container.h     -   do not include "Files.h"
-   container.cpp   -   do not include <iostream>, it gets it from container.h
-   container       -   at function uses an exception instead of assert (this is fine)
-   container       -   pop_back should use an assertion for an empty array

Phase III: Complete
